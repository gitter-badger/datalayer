title: Contributions

Datalayer relies on open-source for this and contributes back via the [Datalayer Contrib](https://github.com/datalayer-contrib) Github repositories. While the `contrib` path is the place to hack before being released in the Datalayer solutions, this is also an opportunity for developers to test those new functionalities as soon as possible. We then assemble all those `contribs` with our open solutions to build an awesome Big Data Sicence platform.

**You are also welcome to contribute on the base source code available in our [Github repositories](https://github.com/datalayer).**
