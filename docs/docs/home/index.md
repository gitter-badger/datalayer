title: Datalayer Science Platform
---

Datalayer is building a solution for Big Data Scientists designed to be `Simple`, `Collaborative` and `Multi Cloud`.

The `Datalayer Science Platform` platform is particulary suited for Data Science exploration teams and is open source under the [Apache License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) (source code available in our [Github repositories](https://github.com/datalayer/)). [Version 0.0.1](/docs/releases/v-0.0.1) is released and fully supported on AWS Amazon Cloud. Today, you can create Kubernetes cluster on the AWS Amazon cloud and deploy as many as you want Apache Zeppelin based Notebooks with Apache Spark (data analytics) and Apache Hadoop (distributed file system) running natively on K8S. You will also get a K8S Dashboard with Heapster to monitor resources usage.

Last but not least, we also ship the premises of `Kuber Plane`, a nice user interface to control your cluster which also acts as a collaborative Data Science Notebook to share datasets analysis with authentication via Twitter OAuth.

Test it with the provided [quick start guide](/docs/quick-start). We are looking forward to your feedbacks on the current version and inputs on our [release plan](/docs/releases) to fit your needs, especially in terms of Applications (Jupyter Notebooks..), Storage, Cloud... you want to use.

**You are welcome to contribute on this project as a User or as a Developer hacking on the base source code available in our [Github repositories](https://github.com/datalayer).**

**Send feedback or question to our Twitter account [@datalayerio](https://twitter.com/datalayerio).**
