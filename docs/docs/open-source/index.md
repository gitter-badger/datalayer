title: Open Source

Datalayer source code is released under the [ASL2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) Apache Licence and uses as its core component open-source software.

Datalayer also contributes back via the [Datalayer Contrib](https://github.com/datalayer-contrib) Github repositories.

While the `Open Source` path is the place to hack before being released in the Datalayer solutions, this is also an opportunity for developers to test those new functionalities as soon as possible.

We assemble all those `components` with our open solutions to build an awesome Big Data Science platform.

**You are also welcome to contribute on the base source code available in our [Github repositories](https://github.com/datalayer).**

We also encourage you to bring more verticals into our current horizontal offering.

As a company, if you need a fully supported solution, Datalayer provides subscriptions based support.
