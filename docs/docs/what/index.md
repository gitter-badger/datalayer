title: Datalayer Offering
---

We ship [Kuber](/docs/what/kuber) to create a Kubernetes cluster on Amazon AWS from scratch.

We also ship a [Data Studio](/docs/what/studio) for Data Scientists who are willing to get the best from Apache Spark and Hadoop. The Studio helps the Data Science project actors to collaborate and share their knowledge in a [Library](/docs/what/library) which exposes searchable higher level of abstraction such as `Datasets`, `Books`, `Functions` and `Models`.

This is the overall architecture that sustain those goals is depicted here after. We fully support the usage of the exploration artifacts stored in the library into a [Production](/docs/why/exploration-to-production) environment.
