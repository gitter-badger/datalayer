title: Datalayer Offering
---

We ship [Kuber](/docs/what/kuber) to create a Kubernetes cluster on Amazon AWS from scratch.

We also ship a [Data Explorer](/docs/what/explorer) for Data Scientists who are willing to get the best from Apache Spark and Hadoop.

The Explorer helps the Data Science project actors to collaborate and share their knowledge in a [Library](/docs/what/library) which exposes searchable higher level of abstraction such as `Datasets`, `Notes`, `Gists`, `Functions` and `Models`.

This is the overall architecture that sustain those goals is depicted here after. We fully support the usage of the exploration artifacts stored in the library into a [Alpha](/docs/why/exploration-to-alpha) environment.
