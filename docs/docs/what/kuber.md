Create from scratch and manager a Kubernetes cluster with the Datalayer Science Platform setup with the `Kuber CLI`. You can also use the CLI to monitor and deploy applications on top of the K8S cluster.

If you prefer an User Interface, we also ship `Kuber Board` which bring the next level of control and monitoring. You can also further analyses with the same power usage and metrics collected from the K8S resouces to optimize your costs and enhance the performance for your end users.

We also enable the usage of low low cost cluster resources such as Spot Instances that can even span multiple Virtual Private Networks.
