Datalayer targets 2 categories of user who will create and use cost effective clusters of size they need without needing prior IT skills:

1. Standalone Data Scientists.
2. Small to Medium Business Teams.

If you are a `Standalone Data Scientist`, you will have all three following profiles. If you are a `Small to Medium Business Team`, you many assign the 3 profiles to different persons.

In both cases, Datalayer solutions make life easier, more productive, cheaper and bring more business value for you.

1. [As Devops](/docs/who/devops), you use the `Kuber CLI` to create the Kubernetes cluster and deploy the needed Applications. You also get the `Kuber Board` WEB user interface if you prefer fancy screens. This is achieved in `Exploration` and `Production` environments.
2. [As Data Scientists](/docs/who/data-scientists), you use the `Data Studio` to request cluster resources for a certain period of time. You explore and share insights in a visual way, in private or in public (e.g. on Twitter).
3. [As Business](/docs/who/business), you review the Data Scientist insights in their favorite environement like Microsoft Office 365.
