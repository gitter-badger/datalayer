Data Analytics is sometimes arid. We want make life more plesant with beautiful and collaborative user interfaces so the Data Science days are fun and not a breeze.

The Dataset are now bigger and bigger. With Datalayer, no more issue. We ship by default Big Data storage (Apache Hadoop) and analytics (Spark) so you are not limited. This allows also to fully reuse what you have done in the Exploration for your Production. Still with the ease and flexibility of the well knwon Python, R... tooling most Data Scientists love to work with.
