The `Datalayer Science Platform` runs on any Kubernetes cluster. A cheap cluster can created by [Kuber](/docs/kuber) or if you are targetting higher budgets for production grade requirements, on any other Kubernetes compliant cluster such as [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks) or [Azure AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service).
